/* POSITIONS-The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky). */
/* ABSOLUTE */
/* An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements. */
/* NB: TAKE NOTE OF THE USE OF %, px, rem . it changes the positioning */
